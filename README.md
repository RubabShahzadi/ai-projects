AI Projects Collection

This repository contains multiple AI/ML projects I built using Python, Google Colab, Hugging Face, LangChain, Groq API, and deep learning models. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), or computer vision.

Projects Included
1. Chatbot (Groq API + LLAMA + Gradio)

Real-time conversational AI with contextual responses.

Uses Groq API and LLAMA 3 for language understanding.

Implements prompt engineering to improve accuracy and conversation flow.

2. Sentiment Analyzer (Hugging Face + Gradio)

Transformer-based text classification model.

Live input sentiment detection (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

Useful for customer feedback or social media sentiment analysis.

3. RAG-based PDF Reader (LangChain + Groq + Streamlit)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent Q&A from PDF documents.

Uses FAISS vector database and Hugging Face embeddings.

Provides natural-language answers in real time.

4. Brain Tumor Segmentation (TransUNet / UNet + Flask)

Deep learning model for MRI brain tumor segmentation.

Includes preprocessing, augmentation, and Flask-based web interface for mask visualization.

5. Cat vs Dog Image Classifier (MobileNetV2 + Gradio)

Image classification using transfer learning.

Fine-tuned model for real-time predictions with Gradio UI.

How to Use

Open any .ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your own API key where required (e.g., Groq API).
